# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a sorting algorithm visualizer implemented using the Pygame library in Python. It allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

## How to Use

1. Ensure that Pygame is installed. You can install it using the command `pip install pygame`.
2. Run the script `sorting_visualizer.py`.
3. The application window will open, displaying a randomly generated list of numbers.
4. Press the following keys to interact with the visualizer:
   - **R**: Reset the list with a new random configuration.
   - **SPACE**: Start sorting the list using the currently selected sorting algorithm.
   - **A**: Sort the list in ascending order.
   - **D**: Sort the list in descending order.
   - **I**: Select Insertion Sort as the sorting algorithm.
   - **B**: Select Bubble Sort as the sorting algorithm.
   - **S**: Select Selection Sort as the sorting algorithm.
   - **M**: Select Merge Sort as the sorting algorithm.
   - **Q**: Select Quick Sort as the sorting algorithm.
5. The sorting process will be visualized in the application window. The algorithm's name and sorting order will be displayed at the top.
6. Once the sorting process is complete, you can perform further actions as described above.

## Dependencies

The sorting algorithm visualizer relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

You can install Pygame using the command `pip install pygame`.
